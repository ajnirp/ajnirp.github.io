in-place so that:\n\nall elements less than the pivot value come first, followed by\nall elements equal to the pivot value, followed by\nall elements greater than the pivot value?\n\nThis problem shows up in quicksort, of which it’s the only really complicated part in my opinion.\nThere's an elegant algorithm to solve this problem. It makes a single pass over the array and uses constant extra space! The implementation is easy enough to understand, but I had trouble understanding why it worked at all. That is, until I looked at it from the perspective of maintaing invariants.\nThe key idea is to define a set of invariants and ensure that they are all true at the beginning of every loop iteration, and also after all iterations are completed. In other words, we must ensure they're all true before any iterations have occurred, before the second iteration starts, before the third iteration starts... and finally when all iterations have completed.\nWhat should our invariants look like? Well, they follow from the problem statement. Let's use three indices i, j, k to carve up our array into four sections, and choose our invariants to be:\n\nItems less than the pivot are at indices &lt; i\nItems equal to the pivot are at indices &gt;= i and &lt; j\nUnclassified items are at indices &gt;= j and &lt; k\nItems greater than the pivot are at indices &gt;= k\n\nAt the end of our loop iterations, no element should remain unclassified, which means section 3 should be empty, which means our terminating condition is j == k.\nKnowing that we want our invariants . Before the iteration starts, assuming the array is 0-indexed, the indices should be initialized as follows:\n\ni = 0. Initially, nothing is less than the pivot - we haven’t seen anything.\nj = 0. everything in the range [0, len(array)) is unclassified.\nk = len(array). Nothing is greater than the pivot because we haven’t seen anything.\n\nThe hard part is to figure out what goes in the loop body. Remember, whatever we do in a single loop iteration, we must end with all invariants remaining true. At the same time, we want to make progress. In our formulation, progress means either incrementing j or decrementing i.\nIn this article we'll skip over how to derive the algorithm from first principles, and instead directly present it. Here it is, in Rust:\n\nThe if conditions that make up the body of the loop are clear. But how do we know which indices to update inside the if conditions? The underlying idea is: any time it's safe to \"advance\" an index (increment in the case of i and j, decrement in the case of k), do it.\nLet's analyze this case by case!\narray[j] &lt; pivot\nAfter incrementing indices i and j, and swapping the elements at those incremented indices:\n\nWe first can swap the elements are indices i and j. Next, we increment index i because it's safe to do so - everything to the left of index i is still less than the pivot even after incrementing. This means invariant 1 is maintained!\nNext, notice how the element that used to be at index i was equal to the pivot (because of invariant 2), and now it's at index j. So we increment index j since invariant 2 holds even after incrementing j.\nInvariant 3 is still true, because we now have one less unclassified element.\nInvariant 4 is still true, because index k didn't change.\n\narray[j] == pivot\nAfter incrementing j:\n\nInvariant 1 is still true, because index i didn't change.\nInvariant 2 is still true. All array elements between indices i and j (excluding the element at index j) are equal to the pivot.\nInvariant 3 is still true, because we now have one less unclassified element.\nInvariant 4 is still true, because index k didn't change.\n\narray[j] &gt; pivot\nWe first decrement k and then swap the elements at indices j and k. This preserves invariant 4.\n\nInvariants 1 and 2 are still true, because neither index i nor index j changed.\nInvariant 3 is still true, because we now have one less unclassified element.\nInvariant 4 is still true. Why? Because initially the element at index j was greater than the pivot. We decremented index k and then swapped the elements at indices j and k, so now the element at index k is greater than the pivot. All elements to the right of the new value of index k continue to be greater than the pivot, as they were before.\n\nWhen the iteration ends, all invariants still hold. Additionally, the \"unclassified\" group empty (because j == k), and so all elements are sorted.\nIf you find this sort of invariant-based analysis interesting, consider reading up on Program Derivation, in particular the book Programming: The Derivation of Algorithms by Anne Kaldewaij. A powerful idea in program derivation is that you can write a program by methodically translating invariants into pseudocode. This is nice because it's typically much easier to formulate invariants for a given problem statement than to directly write a bug-free program.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dutch-national-flag/","title":"Understanding the Dutch National Flag algorithm"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lambda-calculus/":{"body":"This blog post is an introduction to the lambda calculus.

It specifies how to define functions and how to apply them to other arguments - which are themselves functions by virtue of the fact that the lambda calculus doesn't specify how to define anything other than a function. Despite this minimalism, the lambda calculus is equivalent to a Turing machine.\nA name or variable is an identifier, usually a lowercase letter. A lambda is a function with no name. It consists of a list of space-delimited names following the λ symbol. Following the argument list is an arrow → and the body of the lambda, which is an expression.\nWhat is an expression? An expression is either a name (defined above), a lambda (defined above) or an application. An expression can have a pair of parentheses () surrounding it. This doesn't change anything in the expression, but it can make reading easier sometimes.\nA application is two expressions written with a space in between. The first expression is said to be applied to the second. In lambda calculus, the convention is to associate from the left. So the application x y z is read as \"x applied to y, and the result is then applied to z\". Alternatively, this can be read as \"x is applied to both y and z\". Both interpretations are valid and in fact the same. Note that both these interpretations are different from this one: x (y z). Can you say why?\nExamples\nλ x y → x y y is an example of a lambda. The x y after the λ is the argument list. The x y y after the arrow is the body of the lambda. If you were to describe this function in words, you might say \"a lambda that takes two arguments, duplicates the second and applies the first to them\".\n(λ x y → x y y) f g is an example of a function application. The lambda we just defined is applied to two variables f and g, which are themselves functions - after all, everything in the lambda calculus is an anonymous function. To apply a function to some expressions, substitute each expression in the corresponding lambda. In this case, the application yields:\n\nWe proceeded in two steps. After the lambda was applied to f, x got substituted with f. We then had a lambda that accepted only a single argument y, duplicated it, and applied f to both. Next, this new lambda was applied to g. y got substituted with g, and we were left with f g g.\nHere's another example. Consider the lambda λ x → x x. It's known as the U combinator, and all it does is apply its only argument to itself. If we pass the U combinator to itself, what do we get?\n\nSince the argument being passed to the first U also contains an x, we need to first rename it to something else to prevent a name clash. This is known as alpha renaming.\n\nSo x must be substituted by (λ y → y y) in the body of the first U - which is x x. This would yield\n\nwhich is the U combinator applied to itself again. So U U is an infinite program - and in fact, since it regenerates itself at every step, it is a quine!\nAbout this article\nIn this article, we'll look at how the lambda calculus implements some concepts that we expect from programming languages - numbers, arithmetic, logic, control flow, and recursion. It's really interesting to see how in spite of being an extremely minimal language, the lambda calculus is able to support all these concepts by building abstraction upon abstraction. Along the way, we'll try to understand the intuition behind some of these implementations.\nNumbers\n0 is λ s z → z. It ignores its first argument and returns the second one unmodified. 1 is λ s → s (s z). 2 is λ s z → s (s (s z)). And so on. Essentially, a number in the untyped lambda calculus says \"give me a function and another argument, and I'll apply the function this many times to that argument.\" This is why 0 ignores its first argument - applying a function zero times to a value means simply not changing the value at all.\nThat's just the whole numbers, though. What about negative integers? We'll get there.\nArithmetic\nSuccessor\nThe successor function is S = λ w y x → y (w y x). When applied to a number, it returns the next number, like so:\n\nOk, great, it works out. But why does the successor function need three arguments? As it turns out, the difference between M and M+1 is a single extra application of the s parameter. So we need one parameter for that - this is the w parameter - and two more parameters y and x to consume the two formal parameters of M! This is the importance of the (w y x) bit - we are resolving M in the context of y and x and then applying y once more outside the brackets.\nAddition\nThe successor function also works as an addition operator, because M S N, as per our intuition about numbers, is S applied M times to N. Adding M to N is therefore the same as incrementing the number N a total of M times. Nice - we got two functions for the price of one.\nMultiplication\nMultiplication is M = λ x y z → x (y z). This is also called the B combinator, but never mind that. How does it work?\n\nThat last line was a technique known as eta-conversion. Eta-conversion says that if E is an expression in which x is NOT a free variable, then E is the same as λ x → E x. We're essentially taking an expression E and applying it to a variable x that is bound by a lambda we just introduced, and which does not itself appear in E. In the last line above, we eta-converted by adding in a t parameter. Now we can uncurry the above line to get\n\nin other words, apply z to t B times. Then, apply that function to u A times.\tIn other words, do the operation \"apply z to t B times\" a total of A times - but to what? To the variable u - which is just a dummy variable we introduced so that A would have two arguments! Remember, our whole numbers are represented by functions which take two arguments each.\nSo, we have: \"apply z to t a total of A * B times\". And that's just another way of stating the function\n\nwhich in turn is the number A * B in our representation.\nLogic\nYay logic! Specifically, Boolean logic.\nTo have Boolean logic we need truth and falsity. The value T is λ x y → x and the value F is λ x y → y (Kind of like Scheme's car and cdr, but I digress).\nWhat else do we need? Right, Boolean operations.\n\n\nAND is λ x y → x y F. Why? Let's look at each case. If x is F, F y F is F regardless of y. If y is F, it doesn't matter if x is T (picks the first one) or F (picks the second one) - either way, F is going to be picked. And if both x and y are T, T T F is T.\n\n\nOR is λ x y → x T y. The reasoning is similar.\n\n\n(The other two combinations, by the way, aren't as interesting. x F y turns out to be y AND NOT x. x y T turns out to be NOT (x AND NOT y). Oh well.)\n\n'NOT' is λ x → x F T. Easy. (λ x → x T F on the other hand is just the identity function.)\n\n(Side note: F and 0 have the same definition, but you probably already noticed this :) )\nControl flow\nWe get if conditions via the Z predicate. The Z stands for zero? - it takes a single whole number input and returns T if the input is 0, and F otherwise. The predicate itself is λ x → x F NOT F and the way it works is pretty cool. Recall that in our lambda calculus, numbers specify the number of times to apply a function. If we pass 0 to Z, we get 0 F NOT F, which is NOT F - since 0 ignores its first argument - which in turn is T. If we pass any other whole number M, we get M F NOT F, which resolves as\n\nWe didn't have to worry about the contents of that something - after all, F is defined as λ x y → y, meaning that it simply discards its first argument and returns the second one.\nTuples\nTo represent a pair (a, b), we use the function λ z → z a b. We extract its first element with T like so:\n\nand its second element with F like so:\n\n(remember what we said earlier about T and F being like car and cdr respectively?)\nAlso, since a pair is just a 2-tuple and there is nothing special about the number 2 in this context, we could very well define an n-tuple (a1, a2, a3, ..., an) with the function z → z a1 a2 a3 ... an. This is a digression, though. Pairs are enough for what we're about to do next, which is...\nMore arithmetic\n...subtraction!\nPredecessor\nHow do you subtract 1 from a number N using only the tools we've defined thus far? We have addition, multiplication, tuples and boolean logic in our toolkit. Multiplication doesn't seem to be a good choice. Boolean logic would help with branching, as we've seen above, but it's unlikely we'd need to branch just to define subtraction. Addition seems like a good bet - it is after all the inverse of subtraction. And tuples? Let's see.\nKeeping with our addition-based line of thought, one idea is to represent N-1 by adding N-1 to 0, or in other words, incrementing 0 a total of N-1 times using our successor function. How do we represent N-1, though? After all, this is what we're aiming for in the first place. The trick is to apply the same function N times to a pair, after which one of the pair's elements will equal N-1.\nTake a look at this function:\n\nLet's call it PHI. Given a pair λ z → z a b, it returns the pair λ z → (S a) a. So if you pass it a pair (n, n-1), it will return the pair (n+1, n). And if you pass it the pair (0, 0), it will return the pair (1, 0). This is the key to finding the predecessor of a number N. We apply PHI to (0, 0) a total of N times. The first time we get (1, 0). After N-1 more rounds we get (N, N-1). Then we use cdr aka F to extract the second element of the pair. So our predecessor function P is\n\nAlso note that if n is 0, we get P 0 = F, and F is really 0 in disguise. So the predecessor of 0 is 0 itself. This seems like a silly property, but it will be useful soon.\nSubtraction\nJust like addition and the successor operator, subtraction is achieved by repeatedly applying the predecessor operator. M P N is \"apply P to N a total of M times\" - in other words, N - M. Note that since the predecessor of 0 is 0, if M is greater than N we will at some point be repeatedly applying P to 0, and our final result will be just 0.\nDivision\nThere isn't a short combinator for division analogous to multiplication that I know of, but division can be formulated as a recursive problem - and we'll see how in a later section.\nComparisons\nTo test if a number x is greater than or equal to y, subtract x from y by decreasing y a total of x times. If you're left with 0, x must have been at least as large as y. So our function GE is:\n\nA similar test can be used for LE, lesser than or equal to:\n\nFor GT, greater than, we simply use NOT LE. Likewise, LT is NOT GE.\nNote by the way that if the predecessor of 0 were not 0, none of the above definitions would work. See, I told you this property would come in handy.\nWhat about equality? If and only if x &gt;= y and y &gt;= x both hold, then x = y. So our EQ function is:\n\nOur not equal (NE) function is NOT EQ.\nRecursion\nIn recursion as we know it in most programming languages, a function calls itself within its definition, and an edge case terminates the recursion. Like so:\n\nThere are cleverer ways to write this function. We could rewrite it in tail-call-recursive form, for example. But fundamentally, the problem is that we are referring to the function name inside the body of the function. How would we do this in the lambda calculus? The whole point of the lambda calculus is that everything is expressed by the application of nameless functions.\nHow do you refer to something when it has no name?\nBehold:\n\nThis function is known as the Y combinator. What makes it special? Pass it a function argument R:\n\nLook at the first and last lines. Y R = R (Y R). The right hand side is what we were looking for - a way to call R from within itself. This is what makes the Y combinator useful. It lets us use recursion in the untyped lambda calculus. If we want to recursively call a function from within itself, we simply pass it as an argument to the Y combinator.\nWhat could be an example of a function that we might want to call recursively? When college students are taught about recursion a common pedagogical example is the factorial function mentioned above. Let's set that aside in favour of an even simpler example that the reference paper for this article uses - summing the first n numbers.\nThe sum of the first n numbers is n plus the sum of the first n-1 numbers. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the sum is simply 0.\nNow let's think about how our recursive function should look.\nFirst off: how many arguments should it take? We have only one numerical parameter n, so \"one\" is a good first guess. But we're working within the constraints of the Y combinator. Since Y R expans to R (Y R), this means that R must take at least one more parameter, corresponding to this (Y R). What does this other parameter represent? The recursive call of course!\nSo let's try to write our recursive function with two arguments.\n\nHere, r, the first parameter, represents the recursive call we will make somewhere in the body of our function R. n is the number upto which we want to sum, starting from 0.\nIn the description of our recursion, we have an if condition - is n zero or not. We only know of one way to express branching - the zero? predicate we defined earlier. It seems to be a good fit.\n\nIf n is 0, we get\n\nand if not,\n\nwhich is what we want. Nice. Now let's think of what we should put in the body. Our recursive call will return the sum from 0 to n-1. We need to add n to that. So this should work:\n\n...er, wait a minute. r isn't the result of our recursive call, it's just the function that makes the recursive call. So it needs an argument of its own. In this case, the argument should be n-1, which in our lambda calculus is P n. And so we get:\n\nNow let's try to run our function. On paper, of course.\n\nWe started out with Y R 3 and ended up with 3 S (Y R 2). There's the recursion we wanted!\nNow let's run the above step two more times. As you can guess, we'll get 3 S (2 S (1 S (Y R 0))). Y R 0 would expand to give us\n\n(See how Z 0 broke the recursion? Good old Z. Where would we be without it?)\nOur final result is therefore 3 S (2 S (1 S 0)), that is, 6. Hooray! Now let's do the factorial function. What changes do we need to make?\n\n\nThe base case is still n = 0. But now the return value of the base case should be 1.\n\n\nWe have to multiply n with the result of the recursive call.\n\n\nAnd so our function becomes:\n\nFor kicks, let's also do division. Again, the pattern is the same, with only minor variations.\n\nx and y are the two arguments, and we want to find the quotient when y is divided by x. The base case is that x is greater than y - in this case, the quotient is zero. Otherwise, the quotient equals 1 plus the quotient when y - x is divided by x.\nNegative numbers\nNegative integers are represented with pairs: we use a pair λ z → z a b to represent the number a - b. This of course requires that we change the definitions of our successor / addition and predecessor / subtraction functions so that they can work with pairs. Let's do that.\nRaúl Rojas wrote a beautiful paper back in 1997 introducing the lambda calculus. The paper explains the untyped lambda calculus from first principles in very plain language and was the only text that really made me understand the basics. This blog post is a collection of notes to accompany the paper - essentially, a summary of the paper mixed in with the insights I had while trying to understand it, as well as solutions to a couple of the easier problems posed at the end.\nSuccessor\n\nThe meaning is clear enough. The successor of a - b is (a + 1) - b. Also, note that the first line expresses our intent more clearly - take a pair and return another pair whose values are derived from the original pair. The second line is just an uncurried version of the first.\nWhat else? Right, predecessor. Here we go:\nPredecessor\n\nPretty much the same as above. By the way - would λ p z → z (P (p T)) (p F) be a valid definition for P'? (Hint: consider what happens when the first element of the pair is 0)\nAddition\n(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + c) - (b + d), so:\n\nSubtraction\nSimilar logic. (a - b) - (c - d) = (a - c) - (b - d), so:\n\nConclusion\nThe above was a brief introduction to the lambda calculus. We haven't touched upon some other interesting topics, like how lists are represented in the lambda calculus, and how one can write functions to operate on such lists. More on this to come!\nReference\nRaúl Rojas wrote a beautiful paper back in 1997 introducing the lambda calculus.

It is more or less taken directly from Ullman and Hopcroft's excellent textbook on Automata Theory.\nNote: this post presumes knowledge of the concept of undecidability.\nThe technique of problem reduction can be used to say whether a program is undecidable. We know that the question \"given a program and some input, does the program print hello world when run?\" is undecidable. Let's call this question P.\nWhen we are given a different question Q and we want to prove that it is undecidable, we can follow the method that was used to prove that P is undecidable. This is a proof from first principles, and it resembles the diagonal method argument put forward by Cantor to prove that real numbers are uncountably infinite. But often it is easier to proceed via the method of reduction. We look for a way to reduce P to Q. This means proving that P is a special case of Q, or equivalently, that being able to solve Q means being able to solve P.\nHow do we do this? We think of a procedure that takes an instance of Q and turns it into an instance of P. Then we note that if Q is decidable, so is P - since given any instance of Q we have a procedure to turn it into an instance of P.\nEffectively, we are proving that Q is a harder problem than our original problem P. If the harder problem is decidable, so is the easier problem. And since the easier problem P isn't decidable, neither is our harder problem Q.\nExample\nSuppose Q is the question \"given a program PROG1 and some input, does the program ever call a function foo() when it is run?\" Let's use problem reduction to prove that Q is undecidable. We'll start with an arbitrary instance of Q and think of a procedure to turn it into an instance of our original hello-world problem P.\nHere is what we will do.\n\nIn program PROG1, if there is a function named foo(), rename it to something else, and rename all invocations of foo() to this new name as well. It doesn't matter what we rename it to. The point is to avoid a namespace clash.\nAdd a function named foo() to PROG1 with an empty body.\nAt every point in the program where output is done, add a function check() which checks if \"hello world\" has been printed thus far - and if yes, calls the function foo(). Exactly how check() is implemented isn't important. One way might be to have a global growable array of characters which is pushed into each time a character is printed. check() would then simply check if the array contains the characters \"hello world\" in that order.\n\nWe have modified the initial program PROG1. Let's call this new program PROG2. By our construction, PROG1 and PROG2 behave identically in all respects when given the same input, except that PROG2 always calls foo() in situations where PROG1 prints hello world. Conversely, if PROG2 calls foo() we can be sure that PROG1 must have printed hello world. There is no other way in which PROG2 can call foo(), since we designed it that way.\nIn other words, the statement 'PROG1 prints hello world' always has the same truth value as the statement 'PROG2 calls a function named foo()'.\nNow if Q were decidable - that is, we could always determine if a program calls a function named foo() given some arbitrary input - then we could determine if PROG1 would print \"hello world\" given some arbitrary input. This means P would be decidable. But it isn't, and so Q in turn isn't decidable.\nThe key word is arbitrary. Every instance of Q should be convertible to an instance of P. The mapping need not be one-one, but at the very least it should account for every member of Q.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/problem-reduction/","title":"Problem Reduction"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rotate-square-matrix/":{"body":"How do you rotate a square matrix counter-clockwise? That's easy enough: you map the cell located at  to the cell located at , where  is the length of a side of the square matrix.\nToday I stumbled across another way to do this. The idea is to flatten the matrix out and derive a linear map between the 1D indices of the flattened matrix and the 1D indices of the flattened rotated matrix. The relation is . That is, given an index  into the flattened version of the original matrix, the corresponding index in the flattened version of the rotated matrix will be .\nThe index  is an integer between  and , because it is an index into the flattening of a square matrix of side . In fact, . Intuitively, we make r jumps of stride n, and then offset ourselves by c to get to the cell located at . Note that  and  are integers lying in .\nHow do we derive the relation ? By trial and error. My starting point was to take a 4x4 matrix and rotate it to the left, and to observe that there was an even spacing between the values of the 1D indices in the output - and that that spacing was equal to  itself. It was natural to guess that there was a modulo  involved, but that failed very quickly. I then tried , and it worked!\nWhy does this work? The derivation is straightforward. We relate 2D coordinates in a square matrix to the index of the corresponding cell in the flattened version: . We already know how to map 2D coordinates between matrices when one is a left-rotation of the other. So we just need to derive a relation between the 1D indices, and we're done.\n\nThe second line above comes from the formula for mapping a 2D coordinate to a 1D one in the flattened array. Here the coordinate is , which is where  goes after we rotate the matrix.\n\n...and we're done.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rotate-square-matrix/","title":"Rotating a Square Matrix"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ruler-series/":{"body":"This blog post discusses the solution to one of the exercises in an online course I've been doing in my spare time.\nProblem Statement\nThe context of the problem is learning to use lazy evaluation. We start by defining a data structure called a Stream. It is a generic list similar to the built-in one in Haskell, except that it is necessarily infinite. It is defined like so:\n\nSimple enough. A Stream is an element of type a along with another Stream whose elements are also of type a. The S constructor is basically like cons.\nWe can define utility functions for working with Streams analogous to the ones in the Prelude.\n\nFor ease of debugging, it also helps to derive the Show typeclass for Stream to print the first, say, 20 elements.\n\nNow for the problem. The ruler series is defined as the series in which the nth element is the largest power of 2 which evenly divides n. It looks like this:\n\nQuestion: How do you represent the ruler series as a Stream?\nA First Attempt\nThe assignment helpfully suggests:\n\ndefine a function interleaveStreams which alternates the elements from two streams. Can you use this function to implement ruler in a clever way that does not have to do any divisibility testing?\n\nWe know what interleaveStreams should look like. It should take two streams [x1, x2, ...], [y1, y2, ...] and return the stream [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]. How does this help us write a definition for ruler? Well, every alternate element of ruler, starting with the first, is a 0. So ruler might be written as:\n\nThe only question now is, what is &lt;???&gt;. This isn't too hard to answer. If we remove the 0s from ruler, we get this sequence:\n\nwhich, if you look at it carefully, is just the original ruler series with 1 added to every element - in other words, map (+1) ruler!\nWe now have a definition (that doesn't work yet) for ruler:\n\nIt doesn't work because we haven't yet defined interleaveStreams - which, for the sake of brevity, we will now refer to as interleave. How do we do that? My first instinct was to define it like so:\n\nThen I headed over to the ghci prompt, loaded my definitions in, entered ruler and waited expectantly.\nAnd waited. And waited some more.\n\nRefining our solution\n...as you can guess, ghci was sent into an infinite loop trying to evaluate ruler. Why? Let's unravel the evaluation of ruler step by step. Keep in mind that Haskell is lazy, which means that\n\nfunction arguments are evaluated only when they need to be evaluated\nfunction arguments need to be evaluated only when they need to be pattern-matched\nfunction arguments are only evaluated as far as is needed for a match to succeed, and no further\n\nOff we go!\n\ninterleave expects two arguments of the form (S x y) and (S x' y'). Since this is not the case, it attempts to evaluate each of its arguments until they can be represented in this form.\n\nWe've made partial progress. The first argument to the outermost interleave is of the form (S x y). The second argument isn't, though. So we must evaluate it.\n\nmap also expects its second argument to be of the form (S x y). Again, it isn't. So we must evaluate it first before we can evaluate the call to map.\n\nWait a minute, didn't we just see this exact expression? How do we fix this?\nWell, the main reason we ran into an infinite loop above is that we were forced to evaluate the second argument to interleave, which eventually ended up regenerating the original expression. It would be nice if we could recurse without evaluating the second argument. We can't realy avoid evaluating the first argument, since intuitively, something needs to be destructured in order for things to move forward. In any case, the first argument to interleave is repeat 0 - and that is trivially easy to destructure.\nSo we need to write a definition for interleave that forces evaluation of only the first argument. In other words, our definition is constrained to look like this:\n\nHow do we complete the definition? Observe that interleaving the stream (S a1 x) into the stream w...\n\n...is the same as prepending a1 to the result of interleaving w into x:\n\nIn the above text diagrams, x is the stream [a2, a3, a4, ...], and w is the stream [b1, b2, b3, ...]. It's easy to see that (S a1 x) spliced into w is the same as w spliced into x. with the only difference being that the former has an extra a1 at the beginning. So our new definition for interleave is:\n\nThis recursive definition is better than our previous one because it doesn't force Haskell to evaluate the second argument right away. Yay!\nWe can verify that this definition \"works\" - that is, the interpreter is able to lazily evaluate the ruler stream without invoking an infinite loop. Let's re-run the evaluation procedure again and see how things have changed.\n\nand so on and so forth. There's a lot of substitution going on, but notice the general pattern emerging: we obtain an expression of the form S 0 (S 1 (S 0 (...))) - the ruler series. Since it is of the form S x (S y (S z (...))) where x, y, z and so on are all literals, it can be lazily evaluated upto whatever point we need.\nIn the case when we type in ruler at the ghci prompt, as we did above, that point corresponds to 20 terms of the series.\nReferences\nThe course mentioned in the beginning of this post is Brent Yorgey's fantastic Intro to Haskell course.

It is a follow up to my earlier, introductory post on the untyped lambda calculus.\nRecall that the Y combinator is defined like so:\n\nIt takes as input a function argument y and returns the result of applying (λ x → y (x x)) to itself. This means that output of Y R, for some argument R, is R (Y R). Note that both Y R and R (Y R) are partially applied functions.\nIn the previous post we saw how the Y combinator works. We looked at two examples of problems with recursive formulations and saw how to construct functions R such that Y R, when applied to the required arguments, yields the desired result. One insight we had was that since R is called with itself as the first argument, it must be an (n+1)-ary function, where n is the number of formal parameters in the recursive formulation.\nWe also saw why the Y combinator is needed. It gives us a way to express recursive functions in languages that do not natively support recursion - like the untyped lambda calculus.\n\"That great\", you say, \"but where did the Y combinator come from?\". Fair question! In the last post we simply presented the Y combinator instead of deriving it from scratch or supplying the intuition behind it.\nThe latter is what this post will attempt to do.\nOur method is as follows.\n\nWe think of a situation that requires the use of a special kind of function.\nWe write down a crude definition of that function that breaks the rules of the lambda calculus.\nWe then refactor our definition so that it is a valid lambda expression.\nThat special function is our Y combinator.\n\nLet's start with our old friend the factorial function.\n\n(please read the previous post if you aren't sure what this means)\nThe problem with this is that F is not defined until the expression on the right is fully evaluated, which requires an application of F, which requires that F is fully evaluated to begin with. Let's break this cycle. Observe that the right hand side can be seen as a function of F. Sure, it's a lambda taking a single input x, but it could just as well be seen as a function which accepts a single input F', like so:\n\nand so our previous expression can be written as:\n\nA few things to note about this.\n\nThere was nothing special about the factorial function. We could just as well have written the above derivation for any other recursive function.\nThe arity of F wasn't relevant in our derivation either. F could have taken, say, 17 arguments and it wouldn't have made a difference to the logic above.\n\nNow, back to our end result:\n\nThis is interesting. F is a function that takes a number argument (bear in mind that numbers in the lambda calculus are just functions). G is a function that takes as input two arguments: a function F and a number argument x. G F is therefore a partially applied function that takes one more argument as input. This function G F is equal [1] to F, which is the input to G.\nIn other words, F is a fixed point of G. So if we know G, we can find F by finding G's fixed point. How do we do that? Ideally we would have a function Y which would take as input another function and returns its fixed point. This is of course the Y combinator that is the subject of this blog post. Given such a function, we could then pass G to it and get back G's fixed point F. In other words:\n\nand so\n\nNote that the above line doesn't constitute a formal definition of the Y combinator. Why? Because Y appears on the right hand side, and so we have the same issue as we did with F.\nWe need to get rid of Y appearing on the right hand side. How?\nWell, one example of a function that calls its input on itself is the U combinator, which we encountered in the previous post.\n\nHere we have a function Y calling itself. It's tempting to use the U combinator in this setting. But then what should we apply the U combinator to? Let's call the unknown argument to the U combinator H, and try to derive an expression for it. We have:\n\nwhere H is chosen such that the property Y G = G (Y G) is satisfied. Now let's find H.\n\nThe key step here was going from the second line above to the third line. We noticed that the second H in H H was reappearing in G (H H) and could therefore be treated as a parameter of the first H in H H. We then replaced it by a formal parameter x and rearranged things some more.\nLet's check that Y G = H H and H = λ x → G (x x) is enough to satisfy our original constraint Y G = G (Y G).\n\nNice, it works out. So:\n\nwhich is what we were trying to obtain!\nAnd now we have the insight behind the Y combinator. It's just the end result of refactoring the definition of a fixed point for functions that take other functions as input.\nFootnotes\n[1] Note that for two functions to be equal, they must return the same output for every input\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/y-combinator/","title":"Deriving the Y combinator"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dutch-national-flag/":{"body":496,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lambda-calculus/":{"body":1806,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/problem-reduction/":{"body":348,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rotate-square-matrix/":{"body":155,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ruler-series/":{"body":506,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/y-combinator/":{"body":484,"title":3}},"length":8},"lang":"English"}
